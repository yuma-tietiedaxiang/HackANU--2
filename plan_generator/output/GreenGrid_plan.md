# Innovate Project Management Plan

> **Purpose**: Summary of key elements including milestones, budget, reporting and risk management (aligned to AEA template).

## 1. Project aim
This project aims to address the critical challenge of grid instability in communities with high renewable energy penetration. By developing and deploying the GreenGrid Microgrid Optimizer, we will enable real-time coordination of distributed energy resources, thereby preventing blackouts and ensuring reliable power supply. This initiative directly aligns with our organization's strategic objective to foster sustainable energy solutions and enhance grid resilience. The project will advance from Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 4 to TRL 7, demonstrating a significant leap in the maturity and applicability of our innovative technology in real-world operational environments.

## 2. Project objective(s)
The primary objective of this project is to successfully deploy and validate the GreenGrid Microgrid Optimizer across three distinct community energy hubs. Success will be measured by the platform's ability to ensure stable, low-cost energy operations, significantly reduce reliance on traditional diesel backup systems, and demonstrably increase the integration of renewable energy sources. Specific measurable objectives include: 1) Achieving a minimum of 99.9% uptime for the pilot microgrids during the operational phase. 2) Reducing operational costs by at least 15% compared to baseline non-optimized operations. 3) Increasing the average renewable energy penetration within the pilot sites to over 70%. 4) Demonstrating a measurable reduction in diesel generator runtime by at least 50%. 5) Obtaining positive feedback and commitment for ongoing use from at least two of the three pilot community energy hubs.

## 3. Scope and implementation of the project
**Scope**  
The scope of this project encompasses the development, testing, and deployment of the GreenGrid Microgrid Optimizer, a cloud-based energy management platform. This includes the validation of core optimization algorithms, integration with existing distributed energy resources (solar PV, battery storage, and controllable loads) at three selected pilot community energy hubs, and real-time operational monitoring. The project will focus on ensuring grid stability, optimizing energy costs, and maximizing renewable energy utilization within these pilot sites. Excluded from the scope are the physical installation of new renewable energy generation assets or battery storage systems, the modification of existing grid infrastructure beyond necessary communication and control interfaces, and the management of energy trading beyond the immediate needs of the pilot communities. The project will also not cover the development of hardware components, focusing solely on the software optimization platform.

**Implementation**  
The implementation of the GreenGrid Microgrid Optimizer will follow a phased approach, beginning with rigorous algorithm validation and simulation based on historical data from the pilot sites. This phase will ensure the robustness and accuracy of the optimization engine before live deployment. Subsequently, the platform will be integrated with the control systems of the first pilot community energy hub, followed by a period of intensive testing and performance monitoring. Once the initial deployment proves successful, the process will be replicated for the remaining two pilot sites. Each deployment will involve close collaboration with local stakeholders to ensure seamless integration and user acceptance. Continuous data analysis will inform iterative improvements to the optimization algorithms throughout the pilot period, ensuring that the system adapts to real-world conditions and maximizes performance. The project timeline is structured to allow for sufficient testing and refinement at each stage, culminating in a comprehensive evaluation of the system's effectiveness.

## 4. Project participants
Project governance will be managed through a clear hierarchical structure designed to ensure accountability, transparency, and effective decision-making. The Chief Sustainability Officer, Dr. Olivia Martinez, will serve as the Project Sponsor, providing strategic oversight and ultimate decision-making authority. A dedicated Project Lead (to be appointed) will be responsible for day-to-day management, coordination of the project team, and reporting. The core project team, comprising Priya Sharma (Optimization Engineer), Tom Reynolds (Grid Specialist), Mei Chen (Community Engagement Officer), and Liam Scott (Data Analyst), will execute the technical and operational tasks. Regular project team meetings will be held weekly to discuss progress, address challenges, and plan upcoming activities. Monthly steering committee meetings, attended by the Project Sponsor, Project Lead, and key stakeholder representatives, will review overall project status, budget, risks, and key decisions. Risk management will be an integral part of governance, with identified risks regularly reviewed and mitigation strategies updated.
