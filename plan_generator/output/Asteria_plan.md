# Innovate Project Management Plan

> **Purpose**: Summary of key elements including milestones, budget, reporting and risk management (aligned to AEA template).

---

## 1. Project aim
This project aims to deploy Asteria EHR Lite, a cloud-hosted electronic health record system, to address the inefficiencies and risks associated with paper-based or fragmented record-keeping in small medical practices. By providing a streamlined, compliant, and user-friendly digital solution, the project seeks to enhance operational efficiency, improve data accuracy, and ensure robust data security. This initiative directly supports Asteria EHR Lite's strategic goal of becoming a leading provider of accessible and effective health record solutions for the small clinic market, aligning with the broader organizational objective of modernizing healthcare administration. The project commences at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6, representing a system demonstrated in a relevant environment, and aims to conclude at TRL 7, signifying a system prototype demonstrated in an operational environment.

## 2. Project objective(s)
The success of the Asteria EHR Lite pilot deployment will be measured by the achievement of specific, quantifiable objectives focused on operational efficiency, data integrity, and compliance. Key performance indicators include a significant reduction in patient administrative time, measured by a target decrease of 20% in average patient intake duration across the pilot clinics within eight weeks of system implementation. Furthermore, the project will strive for full adoption of electronic prescribing functionalities, aiming for 100% of all prescriptions issued via the system in the pilot sites. Crucially, the deployment must adhere to all Australian privacy and security requirements, specifically the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs), verified through a comprehensive compliance audit. System reliability will be monitored through uptime reports, targeting a minimum of 99.9% monthly availability. These objectives collectively demonstrate the system's effectiveness, usability, and compliance in a real-world clinical setting.

## 3. Scope and implementation of the project
**Scope**  
The scope of the Asteria EHR Lite pilot deployment project encompasses the implementation and evaluation of the Asteria EHR Lite system within three selected small medical clinics. This includes the configuration of the system to meet the specific workflows of these clinics, data migration from existing disparate systems or paper records where feasible, user training for all clinical and administrative staff, and ongoing technical support during the pilot phase. The project will focus on core EHR functionalities such as patient registration, appointment scheduling, clinical note-taking, e-prescribing, and secure messaging integration. Excluded from this scope are major custom software development beyond necessary configurations, integration with third-party systems not explicitly defined in the project plan (e.g., external laboratory systems, advanced billing modules), and the provision of hardware infrastructure for the clinics, as the system is cloud-hosted. The evaluation will be limited to the performance and user experience within the designated pilot sites.

**Implementation**  
The implementation phase will commence with a detailed requirements gathering and workflow analysis at each of the three pilot clinics, ensuring the Asteria EHR Lite system is tailored to their specific operational needs. This will be followed by the configuration and initial setup of the cloud-hosted EHR environment. A critical step involves the secure migration of essential patient data from existing systems, where applicable, to the new platform, with rigorous quality checks to maintain data integrity. User Acceptance Testing (UAT) will be conducted by clinic staff to validate system functionality and usability against defined requirements. Following successful UAT, the system will be deployed across all three pilot clinics in a phased approach, commencing with a go-live date targeted for March 15, 2026. Post-deployment, intensive support will be provided to end-users to address any immediate issues and facilitate smooth adoption. The implementation will be closely monitored against predefined milestones, with regular feedback loops established to address any emerging challenges and ensure alignment with project objectives.

## 4. Project participants
Project governance will be managed through a clear hierarchical structure ensuring accountability and effective decision-making. The Project Sponsor, Dr. Elise Hart (Chief Medical Officer), provides executive oversight and strategic direction, championing the project within the organization. The Project Lead, Michael Lee (IT Project Manager), is responsible for the day-to-day management of the project, including planning, execution, monitoring, and reporting. A core project team comprising a Business Analyst (Sophia Chen), Lead Engineer (David Brown), Privacy & Compliance Specialist (Emma Davis), and Implementation Specialist (Lucas Patel) will manage specific workstreams. Regular project team meetings will be held weekly to review progress, identify risks, and resolve issues. A Steering Committee, comprising key stakeholders from Asteria EHR Lite and representatives from the pilot clinics, will convene monthly to review major milestones, approve significant changes, and provide strategic guidance. Risk management will be actively overseen, with identified risks assigned owners and mitigation strategies developed and tracked. All decisions impacting scope, budget, or schedule will follow a defined change control process.
