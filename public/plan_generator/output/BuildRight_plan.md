# Innovate Project Management Plan

> **Purpose**: Summary of key elements including milestones, budget, reporting and risk management (aligned to AEA template).

## 1. Project aim
The SiteSafe Tracker project aims to significantly enhance safety compliance within the construction industry by deploying an innovative IoT-enabled platform. This initiative directly supports the company's strategic objective of becoming a leader in construction safety technology, reducing operational risks, and improving overall site efficiency. By providing real-time monitoring and automated compliance logging, the project seeks to create safer working environments, thereby reducing costly incidents and enhancing the company's reputation. The project commences at Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5, representing validation of the core technology in a relevant environment, and aims to reach TRL 7 by its conclusion, signifying system demonstration in an operational environment.

## 2. Project objective(s)
The success of the SiteSafe Tracker project will be measured by its ability to demonstrably improve safety compliance and reduce incidents on construction sites. Key performance indicators will include achieving automated compliance logs for all active zones, a quantifiable reduction in lost-time injuries, and a significant improvement in regulatory audit scores. Specifically, the project aims to achieve the following objectives: 1) Implement and validate the IoT sensor network across a minimum of 10 active construction zones. 2) Achieve 100% automated compliance logging for all deployed sensors, ensuring real-time data availability. 3) Reduce the recordable incident rate by at least 30% year-over-year in pilot sites compared to the previous 12-month period. 4) Attain a minimum regulator audit score of 90% for sites utilizing the SiteSafe Tracker system.

## 3. Scope and implementation of the project
**Scope**  
The scope of the SiteSafe Tracker project encompasses the end-to-end deployment and operationalisation of an IoT-enabled safety compliance monitoring platform across selected construction sites. This includes the procurement, installation, and configuration of IoT sensors, the development and deployment of a central data dashboard, and the integration of automated compliance logging features. The project will cover the full lifecycle from prototype validation through to enterprise-wide rollout, including training for site personnel and initial support. Excluded from this scope are any modifications to existing regulatory frameworks, the development of new sensor hardware beyond the specified prototype, or the management of general site safety protocols not directly related to the IoT monitoring system. The project will focus on construction sites within the metropolitan area for the initial rollout.

**Implementation**  
The implementation of the SiteSafe Tracker project will follow a phased approach, commencing with the validation of sensor prototypes to ensure robust data capture and reliability in demanding construction environments. This initial phase will involve rigorous testing under various site conditions. Following successful validation, a pilot rollout will be conducted at a select number of representative construction sites. This pilot phase is critical for gathering real-world performance data, identifying any system integration challenges, and refining user training protocols. Feedback from the pilot will inform adjustments before the full enterprise rollout. The enterprise rollout will involve the systematic deployment of sensors and the platform across all designated active zones, ensuring comprehensive coverage and data collection. Throughout the implementation, continuous monitoring of system performance, data integrity, and user adoption will be undertaken. Training programs will be delivered to site managers and workers to ensure effective utilisation of the system and its safety compliance features. The project team will work closely with site operations to minimise disruption during installation and integration, ensuring a smooth transition to the new safety monitoring system.

## 4. Project participants
Project governance for the SiteSafe Tracker initiative will be structured to ensure clear accountability, effective decision-making, and robust oversight. The Project Sponsor, James Walker (Head of Operations), holds ultimate accountability for the project's success and alignment with strategic objectives. The Project Manager, Sophia Chen, will be responsible for the day-to-day management of the project, including planning, execution, monitoring, and reporting. A core project team, comprising David Brown (Systems Engineer), Emma Davis (Safety Officer), and Alice Johnson (Tech Specialist), will manage specific workstreams. Key stakeholders, including site managers, construction workers, investors, and state safety regulators, will be engaged through regular communication channels and feedback mechanisms. A Project Steering Committee, to be established, will convene monthly to review progress, address risks and issues, and approve significant changes. This committee will include representatives from SiteSafe Tracker leadership, key operational departments, and potentially external advisors. Risk management will be a continuous process, with identified risks regularly reviewed and mitigation strategies updated. Decision-making authority will be clearly defined, with escalation paths established for critical issues.
